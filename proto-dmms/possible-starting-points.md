#### Scope

It is probably too early to try to implement the whole DMM pipeline along these lines:

Instead I am thinking about experiments with possible parts of this pipeline 
(without much commitment, and trying to keep parts modular and replaceable).

#### Possible starting points

  * `initial_steps.md` in https://github.com/anhinga/2019-design-notes/tree/master/nexus 
    (various drafts related to "flat dmms", which can be both in NumPy and in PyTorch)

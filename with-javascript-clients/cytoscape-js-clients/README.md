Exercises to have Cytoscape.js clients interacting via websockets with a Python server

Include `cytoscape.min.js` from Cytoscape 3.6.2 into this directory to run. Run by opening `index.html`

version4.js - very rudimentary functionality (I would just e-mail it to myself at this stage, but it turns out that Gmail hates Javascript attachments "for security reasons", so I am storing it here instead). This one interacts with https://github.com/anhinga/2019-python-drafts/tree/master/with-javascript-clients/trio-websocket-server

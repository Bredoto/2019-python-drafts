### Remarks on Node Editors

It turns out that the correct terminology for visual programming editors is not _graph editors_, but **node editors** or _node based editors_.

If one searches for existing _graph editors_, there are only a few choices (that include `Cytoscape.js` and `dash-cytoscape` which I experimented with recently).

However, as soon as one searches for _node editors_, there are plenty of choices, with a large variety of aesthetic options, implementation languages, etc. 
Such editors can be open-source and proprietary, stand-alone and existing as parts of larger systems (e.g. Blender, Unity, or Rhino).

For example, a Google search

 * open source node editor python
 
produces a variety of interesting options.
